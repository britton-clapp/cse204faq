Each student starts with a set number of late coupons (7). When a late assignment is graded, a coupon is deducted for each day the assignment is late (so, submitting 1 hour after the deadline or 23 hours after the deadline is the same thing, as you will be using one late coupon). When there are no coupons remaining, points will be deducted for each day that the assignment is late.

You can view how many late coupons you have left by checking the **Late Coupons Remaining** assignment in Canvas.
