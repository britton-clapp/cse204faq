No modifications or exceptions are made to the waitlist for CSE204.

In most cases, there are around 20 students per section who drop the class. This means that if you are at position 20 or below, there is a decent chance that you will be admitted eventually. It's probably wise to attend lectures/zoom sessions and turn in homework on time.

If you are above position 20 on the waitlist, you should probably have a backup plan.
