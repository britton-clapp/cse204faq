title: "Github Pages Link Shows a Blank Page"

In your assignment repository, on github.com, take a look at your index.html file. Your main content should be in index.html. If you have added your content to a different file, you should either:

1. On your computer, delete index.html, and then rename the file with your content to be index.html.
2. Copy the content into index.html.

The blank page is due to the fact that your github pages URL will load index.html by default. If that file is blank, it still gets sent to the browser. This will happen even if you have added content to a different file.
