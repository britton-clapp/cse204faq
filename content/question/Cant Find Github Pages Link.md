Go to https://github.com, make sure you're logged in, and go to your repository for the assignment. Click on the "Settings" tab.

Scroll down to the "Github Pages" settings and change the "Source" to "Master Branch" and click "Save".

Now you should see the message "Your site is ready to be published at" along with a URL. You can view this url to see your website live on the internet! Please copy down this url as you will need to submit it with your assignment. Please note: after "Syncing" changes it may take a few minutes before they appear on the live URL.

*If you still don't see the link, make sure your browser is up to date.* There have been some reports of older versions of Chrome (particularly on Chromebooks) where the link doesn't show up. Try using a different computer if you still don't see the link in the Github Pages section.
