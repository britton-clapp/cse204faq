To submit your assignment to Canvas, you need to get your assignment's _Github Pages_ URL. 

First, open github.com in your web browser. Navigate to the repository for your assignment. Go to the Settings section for the repository.

Scroll down to the Github Pages section. Make sure that *master* branch is selected. Copy the URL and paste that into Canvas.

If Canvas says *Assignment failed to submit*, double-check your URL. If your URL starts with `file:///`, that's just the location of where your assignment is stored _on your computer_. It's kind of like handing in a homework assignment that just says "my work is on my desk at home".
